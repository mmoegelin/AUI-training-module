			<p>
				When you initially load the Dodge Bouncing Balls web page you should see something similar to the picture below.
			</p>
			<img class="user-guide-image" src="images/Start_screenshot.jpg" alt="picture of start screen" />
			<p>
				The picture located below shows all of the buttons that will be displayed during the course of the game.
			</p>
			<img class="user-guide-image" src="images/Display_all_screenshot.jpg" alt="picture of game buttons" />
			<p id="onscreen_items">
				The purpose and use of each button/area will be explained below.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="bold-text">Damage Meter: </span>this shows how much damage the user's ball has incurred. The meter starts empty (white) and fills with orange as damage occurs. Once the meter is completely filled the game ends.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="bold-text">Ball zone: </span>the game itself will take place within this white rectangular area. Balls which the user most avoid will be generated on the top half of this area. The balls will bounce against the outer edges of this area.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="bold-text">User Ball: </span>this is the ball that the user controls during the game. You can move the ball by pressing the up, down, left, or right arrow keys. Movement is restricted to the white 'Ball zone' area.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="bold-text">Start: </span>click this button to begin a new game or to unpause a currently paused game. Once a game has started this button will disappear unless the 'Pause' button or 'New Game' button is pressed.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="bold-text">Pause: </span>click this button to pause an in-progress game. This button is initially hidden but will become visible once a game has started.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="bold-text">Next Level: </span>this is a popup which will be displayed each time the user reaches a new level. New levels can be reached every ten seconds. By default, this pop-up is hidden until the next level is reached; it is then briefly displayed.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="bold-text">Toggle Hints: </span>click this button to display hint popups which give additional information about the game. The pop-ups are hidden by default but can be toggled between hidden and visible by clicking this button.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="bold-text">Add New Ball: </span>click this button while a game is in progress to add a new ball to the ball zone. This button is hidden by default and will only be visible while a game is in progress (and un-paused).
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="bold-text">New Game: </span>this button is hidden by default. When a game ends this button will appear; click the button to reset the game.

The minimum difficulty level is 1 (far left value) and the maximum value is 5 (far right value).
